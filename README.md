# Society Coursework 2
### Task Description
The Department of Computer Science in a prestigious university has a number of new student
societies who will be responsible for promoting an agenda for equality, diversity and
inclusivity (EDI) in the Department. You are asked to build a program that will help the
Department keep track of the membership and activities of each of these student societies.
The Department has agreed a policy that in order for any new society to be created, at least
three members must be present to take on three essential roles of: President, Secretary and
Treasurer for the society. More members can join the society later.
